a GIT watering can.

_Homage to Pieter Hintjens_

---

It is a Scala application to perform silly GitHub history contributions _vandalisms_.

The idea for this application comes from one of the last projects published here on GitHub by [Pieter Hintjens](https://github.com/hintjens).

The name for the application is a simple portmanteau of **GIT** and **Pieter** words. It accidentally becomes a meaningful dutch word, gieter, that stands for "watering can".
